# Java-Employee-Payroll-System

Welcome to the Employee Payroll System project in Java! This repository contains a comprehensive example of building a terminal-based Employee Payroll System using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. 

üîç Project Highlights:

Abstract Employee class serving as the foundation for different employee types.
Concrete subclasses FullTimeEmployee and PartTimeEmployee with salary calculation.
A user-friendly terminal interface for easy interaction and data management.
Demonstrates core OOP concepts with practical coding examples.



üìÅ Repository Contents:

Source code for the Employee Payroll System project.
README with project overview, setup instructions, and usage details.

Through this project, I've learnt how to design and implement abstract classes, concrete subclasses, and explore inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism in Java.
